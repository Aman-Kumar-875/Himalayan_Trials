                            <p>The best seasons for trekking in the Himalayas are pre-monsoon (March to May) and post-monsoon (September to November). During these months, the weather is generally stable with clear skies, offering spectacular mountain views. Winter treks (December to February) are possible on lower altitude routes, while the monsoon season (June to August) is generally not recommended due to rain, leeches, and poor visibility.</p>

                            <p>On most treks, accommodation is in teahouses or mountain lodges - simple, family-run establishments offering basic but clean rooms. Typically, rooms have twin beds with mattresses, pillows, and blankets (we recommend bringing a sleeping bag for hygiene and extra warmth). Bathroom facilities are shared, and hot showers (where available) usually cost extra. In remote areas, facilities are more basic. Premium packages offer the best available rooms at each stop.</p>

                            <p>Teahouses offer surprisingly varied menus, with the staple being "Dal Bhat" (rice, lentil soup, and vegetables) - a nutritious, all-you-can-eat option favored by guides and porters. Other common items include noodles, pasta, potatoes, soups, momos (dumplings), and simple Western dishes. Breakfast options typically include porridge, eggs, pancakes, and toast. Food is prepared fresh but menu variety decreases at higher altitudes. Vegetarian options are always available.</p>

                            <p>We advise against drinking untreated tap or stream water. Safe drinking water is available through:<br>
                            - Boiled water from teahouses (small fee)<br>
                            - Purification tablets or SteriPEN (bring your own)<br>
                            - Water filters (some lodges have filtered water stations)<br>
                            - Bottled water (available but not environmentally friendly)<br>
                            We encourage using refillable bottles with purification methods to reduce plastic waste in the mountains.</p>

These packages also include extras such as higher guide-to-client ratios, more comprehensive first aid kits, and satellite phones. Luxury options are most developed in the Everest and Annapurna regions.</p>
